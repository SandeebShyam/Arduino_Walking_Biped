# Arduino_Walking_Biped
To investigate kinematic concepts, I designed and built myÂ humanoid walking robot. Forward and inverse kinematics methods for bipedal movement have been researched and developed. Tested and analysed motion patterns to improve stability and efficiency. Documented in a detailed paper that demonstrates new insights into humanoid robot kinematics.
